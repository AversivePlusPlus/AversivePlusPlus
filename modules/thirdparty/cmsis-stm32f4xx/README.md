# cmsis-stm32f4xx

## Description

This project is a part of the [Aversive++ library](https://github.com/AversivePlusPlus/AversivePlusPlus).
This is a "third-party" module. The code is taken from the library STM32Cube  F4.
This part is supposed to be common to all STM32 F4 microcontrollers.

The CMSIS STM32F4xx library is an "Hardware Description Layer", 
that enables the user to modify registers as if it was normal variables.
It also defines some values that are used to configure the hardware.
