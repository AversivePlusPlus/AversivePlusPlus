# container

## Description

This project is a part of the [Aversive++ library](https://github.com/AversivePlusPlus/AversivePlusPlus).
This module defines most common containers you can find in computer science (list, queue, stack, heap, buffer, ...).
The particularity of these containers (compared to C++'s stl) is that they don't use dynamic allocations.
Thereby, the user must define the maximum of entities that can be manipulated by an algorithm.
