# Aversive++

This project provides a C++ library that eases microcontroller programming.

Its aim is to provide an interface simple enough to be able to create complex applications,
and optimized enough to enable small microcontrollers to execute these applications.

The other aspect of this library is to be multiplatform.
Indeed, it is designed to provide the same API for a simulator
(named SASIAE) and for AVR-based and ARM-based microcontrollers.

Check the project's [official website](http://aversiveplusplus.com) to have more information.

# Install

There is currently a Windows installer, and a Debian package (for any apt-based distribution).
You can check the [wiki](https://github.com/AversivePlusPlus/AversivePlusPlus/wiki)'s installation tutorials to have more information.

# Build

To build the library from sources, just use this command :

```
make
```

# Documentation

There is some tutorials in the [wiki](https://github.com/AversivePlusPlus/AversivePlusPlus/wiki).
The current API documentation is not available.
